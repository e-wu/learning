Please complete the for loop inside the function ```validateLoop``` by writing to console.log on each loop iteration.

Given start = 0 and end=100, the output must be:
```
1
3
5
7
... ommitted ...
93
95
97
99
```

Notes:
- The ```start``` variable is always 0.
- The ```end``` vairable is always 100.
- Please only write out the index with ```console.log```.
- You must use the ```start``` and ```end``` variables in your for loop.
- You must do everything by modifying the for loop header. The for loop body must remain as for example:
    ```
    function validateLoop(start, end) {
        for (...) {
            console.log(i);
        }
    }
    ```
